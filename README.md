# 🍔 CraveBot

CraveBot is a web app that helps you decide what to eat when you’re out of ideas.  
You enter a craving or just a location, and it finds nearby restaurants using the Google Places API.  
If you leave it blank, CraveBot surprises you with something random — because sometimes, that’s exactly what you need.

Built with **Python** and **Streamlit**, it’s a clean, responsive, and fast app designed to make everyday decisions simpler.

## What It Does

- **Search by craving or go random** — find something new nearby.  
- **Google Maps Integration** — quick links for directions.  
- **Favorites List** — save places you want to remember.  
- **Polished Interface** — smooth animations, gradients, and a mobile-friendly layout.  
- **Smart Image Handling** — if Google can’t fetch one, it grabs a fallback from Unsplash.  
- **Helpful Toasts** — simple pop-ups that don’t interrupt your search.

## Why I Built It

I wanted to create something small but thoughtful — a project that mixes **automation, design, and usability**.  
CraveBot started as a way to explore how AI tools and APIs can make decisions easier, but it’s also become a showcase of what I like to build:  
**interactive, useful, and visually refined web apps.**

I’m currently growing my experience in **automation, web development, and cybersecurity**, and I use projects like this to keep learning and to show what I can do.
